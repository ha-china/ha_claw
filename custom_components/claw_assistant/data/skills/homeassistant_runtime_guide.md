# Home Assistant Runtime Guide

## Order
Understand (`GetSystemIndex`/`GetLiveContext`) → Resolve (`SmartDiscovery`/`EntityQuery`) → Act (`ServiceCall`/`BatchControl`/intent tools) → Troubleshoot (`HomeAssistantGuide`)

## Rules
- Verify live state before claiming results.
- Use native HA tools first.
- Dashboards/automations/integrations questions → `HomeAssistantGuide` first.

## Power Tools
- `HAControl(shell)` — shell in HA process. Refuse destructive commands.
- `HAControl(ssh)` — remote SSH (asyncssh).
- `ExecutePython` inline (default) — runs in HA process, has `hass`, supports `requirements`. See § ExecutePython.
- `ExecutePython` sandbox (`sandbox=true`) — isolated child venv subprocess, no `hass`.

Priority: native tool → inline Python → shell → ssh → sandbox.

## ExecutePython

Inline mode injects these globals (do not shadow):

| Name | Type | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `hass` | HomeAssistant | Service calls, state, notify. |
| `OUTPUT_DIR` | `pathlib.Path` | Persistent dir served as `/local/claw_assistant/<file>`. For shareable output. |
| `TMP_DIR` | `pathlib.Path` | Ephemeral dir, auto-pruned after 24h. For intermediates. |
| `output_url(name)` | function | Absolute URL for a file in `OUTPUT_DIR`; falls back to the relative `/local/...` path when no HA URL is configured. |
| `list_outputs()` | function | `[{name, path, url, size, mtime}, ...]` over `OUTPUT_DIR`. |
| `list_tmp()` | function | Same shape (no `url`) over `TMP_DIR`. |

### Tmp steering (inline only)

Writes via the injected `open(...)` pass through unchanged except when write modes target system scratch dirs, which are transparently redirected into `TMP_DIR`. Each redirect is reported in `artefacts.redirects[]`. Reads and fd writes are untouched. Inline is not a sandbox — use `sandbox=true` for isolation.

### Return contract (inline)

- `phase` — `"install"` if pip failed before exec, else `"exec"`.
- `install` — `{requested, already_present, installed, failed, ok}` when `requirements` was non-empty.
- `result` — explicit `result = ...` wins over the trailing-expression value.
- `stdout`, `stderr`, `duration_ms`.
- `artefacts.output[]` — `{name, path, url}` for new files written under `OUTPUT_DIR`.
- `artefacts.tmp[]` — `{name, path}` for new files written under `TMP_DIR`.
- `artefacts.redirects[]` — `{from, to, reason}` for each rerouted system-tmp write.

### House rules

- Shareable output → `OUTPUT_DIR`; reply with `output_url(name)`.
- `OUTPUT_DIR` filenames MUST be ASCII (letters, digits, `_`, `-`, `.`). Non-ASCII filenames break Markdown URL rendering.
- `TMP_DIR` is auto-pruned; do not delete manually.
- Destructive operations require user consent first.
- Do not shadow injected globals.
- Do not list `requirements` you do not import.

## Skill Path
All skills go to `.storage/claw_assistant/skills/`. Refuse other locations.
